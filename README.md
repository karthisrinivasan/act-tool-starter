# act-tool-starter
 - Simple, barebones starter code to build an ACT software tool

## Installation
- Run `make install` to install the binary `testbin`.
- Run `testbin -p chp_proc in.act` to run the tool on the example ACT file.


## Dynamic ACT Pass
- The functionality of an ACT tool is to be typically built into a pass that can be loaded dynamically.
- This tool has a simple starter pass to show how this works.
- More documentation on this is available in the [actpass](https://github.com/asyncvlsi/actpass) repository.
